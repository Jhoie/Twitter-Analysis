This repo shows the inital steps of data wrangling, cleaning and natural language processing of Twitter data from the Twitter account of Dr. Brandeis Marshall, before the visualizations on Tableau.

## Introduction
Twitter is an American microblogging and social networking service on which users post and interact with messages known as 'tweets'. Users' information is stored on their servers and can be retrieved on request based on their privacy policy. If you wish to retrieve your data from Twitter, you can do so using the steps in this article. https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/accessing-your-twitter-data
Once your data is ready, you can proceed with the following steps to analyze the data

## Action Steps
The codes in the notebook are divided into four major parts
1. DATA WRANGLING: The Twitter data comes in a .js file which is converted to a .csv file for use
2. DATA RESTRUCTURING/CLEANING: Here, the data is cleaned to a suitable state. Columns are dropped and renamed
3. NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) AND REGEX: Tweets generally contain a lot of human-readable text (unstructured data). Before we can analyze such data, it needs to be preprocessed. All these are done in this step
4. VISUALIZATION: The resulting preprocessed data is visualized to get insights on the frequently discussed topics.

## Article
A detailed step by step article/how to guise would be ready would be available in coming weeks. In the meantime, this code can be replicated and should produce the same results with different data
